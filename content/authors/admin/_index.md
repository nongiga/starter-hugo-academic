I am a first-year PhD student at Columbia University's department of Systems Biology, and a recipient of the Open Philanthropy Project Early Career Funding. My current projects focus on using neural embedding to make more sense from genomic data. Previously, I was a student at Kishony Lab at the Technion, where I harnessed novel genomic approaches and big data to investigate how bacterial pathogens evolve upon recurring infections.
